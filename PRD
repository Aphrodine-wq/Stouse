1. Executive Summary

VibeHouse is an AI-driven, end-to-end home construction management platform that transforms the way residential homes are designed, planned, and built. By leveraging generative AI, natural language processing, and deep integration with project management tools, VibeHouse enables a homeowner to describe their dream home in plain language and receive a complete, buildable set of design plans, a fully orchestrated construction schedule, automated vendor procurement, daily build reporting, and an intelligent dispute resolution system.

The platform introduces the concept of "Vibe Coding" a house: users describe the aesthetic, functional, and emotional qualities they want in a home, and the AI translates these into architectural plans, engineering specifications, material lists, contractor assignments, and a living Trello board that serves as the single source of truth for the entire build lifecycle.

Key Value Propositions
	•	Zero-to-Blueprint in Hours: AI generates complete architectural and engineering plans from natural language descriptions, reducing the design phase from weeks to hours.
	•	Autonomous Vendor Orchestration: The platform automatically identifies, contacts, vets, and schedules contractors, suppliers, and inspectors across every trade required for the build.
	•	Living Build Board: A Trello-powered project board that the AI continuously monitors, updates, and uses to drive real-time decision-making and reporting.
	•	Daily Intelligence Reports: Automated reports delivered to every stakeholder with progress metrics, risk alerts, budget tracking, and next-day action items.
	•	Dispute Resolution AI: Proactive identification of conflicts, delays, and disagreements with structured resolution workflows that keep the project moving.
	•	Python-Powered Backend: A high-performance, event-driven backend built on Python with FastAPI, Celery, and PostgreSQL, designed for speed, reliability, and horizontal scalability.

2. Problem Statement & Market Opportunity

2.1 The Problem
Building a custom home is one of the most complex, expensive, and stressful undertakings a consumer will ever face. The current process is fragmented, opaque, and riddled with inefficiencies that cost homeowners an average of 20-30% over budget and 6-12 months of delays. The core problems include:

	•	Fragmented Design Process: Homeowners must hire architects, structural engineers, interior designers, and landscape architects independently, with no unified platform to coordinate their work.
	•	Vendor Discovery is Manual: Finding, vetting, and coordinating dozens of contractors across plumbing, electrical, HVAC, framing, roofing, concrete, landscaping, and more is entirely manual and deeply inefficient.
	•	No Real-Time Visibility: Homeowners lack a single dashboard showing real-time build progress, budget status, and upcoming milestones. Communication happens through scattered text messages, emails, and phone calls.
	•	Disputes Escalate Silently: Disagreements between contractors, between the homeowner and the builder, or about change orders often go unaddressed until they become project-threatening conflicts.
	•	Reporting is Nonexistent: Most homeowners receive no structured reporting on their build. Those who do get weekly or monthly updates that are already stale by the time they arrive.

2.2 Market Opportunity
The U.S. residential construction market represents over $900 billion annually, with custom home construction accounting for approximately $120 billion of that total. The global construction technology market is projected to reach $35 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.2%. Despite this massive market, no existing platform addresses the full lifecycle from design intent to move-in day with AI at its core.

3. Product Vision & Principles

3.1 Vision Statement
"Every person should be able to describe their dream home and watch it come to life, with AI handling the complexity of design, coordination, and construction management from the first sketch to the final walkthrough."

3.2 Core Design Principles

	•	Vibe-First Design: Users describe feelings, aesthetics, and lifestyle needs. The AI translates vibes into specifications. Users should never need to think in architectural terms unless they want to.
	•	AI as Project Manager: The AI is not a passive tool. It is the active project manager that monitors, decides, escalates, and reports. It operates autonomously within defined guardrails and defers to the user only when human judgment is required.
	•	Trello as the Living Contract: The Trello board is the single source of truth. Every stakeholder interacts with it. Every AI action is reflected on it. Every change is tracked through it.
	•	Transparency by Default: Every AI decision, vendor communication, cost estimate, and schedule change is logged, auditable, and visible to the homeowner in real time.
	•	Speed Without Sacrifice: The backend must be blazingly fast. Design generation in under 60 seconds. Vendor matching in under 30 seconds. Board updates in under 5 seconds. Daily reports generated and delivered before 7:00 AM local time.
	•	Dispute Prevention Over Resolution: The system proactively identifies potential conflicts and surfaces them before they escalate. When disputes do occur, structured workflows resolve them quickly with full documentation.

4. User Personas

4.1 Primary Persona: The Homeowner ("The Dreamer")

7. AI Design Engine (Vibe Code Engine)

7.1 Natural Language Design Pipeline
The Vibe Code Engine is the heart of VibeHouse. It accepts natural language input from the user and produces a complete, buildable set of architectural and engineering documents. The pipeline operates in six stages, each producing artifacts that feed into the next.

Stage 1: Vibe Capture
The user describes their desired home through a guided conversational interface. The AI extracts structured requirements from unstructured input using a multi-turn dialogue system. The system captures aesthetic preferences ("I want a warm, modern farmhouse feel"), functional requirements ("4 bedrooms, open kitchen, home office"), site constraints ("0.5 acre lot, gentle slope, south-facing"), budget parameters, and lifestyle needs ("we entertain a lot, need great outdoor living").

Stage 2: Requirement Synthesis
The AI normalizes captured vibes into a structured Requirement Specification Object (RSO) containing room definitions, adjacency preferences, structural constraints, material preferences, code requirements (based on jurisdiction), and budget allocations per system (structural, MEP, finish, landscape).

Stage 3: Floor Plan Generation
Using the RSO, a fine-tuned diffusion model generates multiple floor plan options. Each plan is scored against the requirements using a multi-objective optimization function that weighs spatial efficiency, flow quality, natural light, structural simplicity, and cost. The top 3 plans are presented to the user for selection and refinement.

Stage 4: Engineering Analysis
The selected floor plan is processed through structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing analysis engines. Structural loads are calculated, HVAC sizing is determined, electrical panel layouts are generated, and plumbing routes are planned. All calculations conform to the International Building Code (IBC) and local jurisdiction amendments.

Stage 5: Document Generation
Complete construction document sets are generated including architectural plans (floor plans, elevations, sections, details), structural plans (foundation, framing, connections), MEP plans (mechanical, electrical, plumbing), a complete bill of materials with quantities and estimated costs, and a construction schedule with task dependencies and critical path analysis.

Stage 6: Permit Packaging
Documents are formatted to meet local jurisdiction submission requirements, including title block formatting, sheet indexing, energy compliance documentation (Title 24 / IECC), and site plan overlays. The system maintains a database of submission requirements for major U.S. jurisdictions.

8. Trello Integration & Build Board System

8.1 Build Board Architecture
The Trello Build Board is the operational backbone of every VibeHouse project. It is not a passive Kanban board; it is an AI-monitored, real-time project management surface that every stakeholder interacts with. The AI continuously scans the board for changes, infers intent, updates dependent tasks, and triggers downstream workflows.

Board Structure
Each project generates a Trello board with the following list structure, auto-populated with cards from the construction schedule:

Trello List
Purpose
Card Types
Backlog
All future tasks not yet scheduled
Task cards with dependencies, estimates, assignments
This Week
Tasks scheduled for the current week
Active task cards with daily breakdowns
In Progress
Tasks currently being worked on
Cards moved here by contractors or AI
Blocked
Tasks that cannot proceed
Cards with blocker annotations, auto-escalation timers
In Review / Inspection
Tasks awaiting quality check or inspection
Cards with inspection checklists, photo requirements
Dispute / Hold
Tasks with active disputes or holds
Cards linked to dispute resolution workflows
Completed
Tasks verified as complete
Cards with completion evidence, sign-off records
Change Orders
Scope changes requested or approved
Cards with cost impact, approval status, timeline impact

8.2 AI Board Scanning Engine
The Trello Sync Service continuously monitors the Build Board using a combination of Trello webhooks (for real-time push notifications) and periodic polling (as a reliability fallback). The scanning engine processes the following event types:

	•	Card Moves: When a card is moved between lists, the AI evaluates whether the move is valid (does the task have unresolved dependencies?), updates dependent task timelines, triggers notifications to affected stakeholders, and recalculates the critical path.
	•	Card Comments: Natural language comments from contractors or the homeowner are parsed by the AI. Comments indicating problems ("concrete delivery delayed 2 days") trigger automatic schedule adjustments. Questions ("can we substitute oak for maple?") are routed to the appropriate decision-maker.
	•	Checklist Updates: Inspection checklists and task completion checklists are monitored. When all items are checked, the AI auto-advances the card to the next stage or flags items that need manual verification.
	•	Label Changes: Color-coded labels indicate priority, risk level, and category. The AI monitors label changes and adjusts reporting and escalation behavior accordingly.
	•	Due Date Modifications: Any due date change triggers a cascading dependency analysis. The AI identifies all downstream tasks affected, calculates new projected dates, and generates a schedule impact report.

8.3 Webhook Processing Pipeline

< 5s
7. Sync Back

< 3s

8.4 Board Sync Reliability
To ensure the Trello board and the VibeHouse internal state never diverge, the system implements a three-tier consistency model: real-time webhook processing as the primary sync mechanism, a 60-second polling interval as a secondary fallback that catches any missed webhooks, and a full board reconciliation job that runs every 15 minutes comparing the complete Trello board state against the internal database and resolving any discrepancies.

9. Vendor & Contractor Orchestration

9.1 Vendor Discovery Pipeline
When the construction schedule is finalized, the Orchestration Service automatically identifies the trades required for each phase and begins the vendor discovery and engagement process. The pipeline operates as follows:

	1	Trade Identification: Parse the construction schedule to identify all required trades (e.g., concrete, framing, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, roofing, drywall, painting, flooring, landscaping).
	2	Geographic Search: Query the vendor database and external APIs (Google Places, Yelp, state licensing boards) for licensed contractors within a configurable radius of the build site.
	3	Qualification Filtering: Filter results by license status, insurance coverage, bond status, years in business, online rating thresholds, and any homeowner-specified preferences.
	4	Availability Matching: Cross-reference contractor availability calendars against the project schedule to identify contractors who can meet the required start dates.
	5	AI Ranking: Score qualified contractors using a composite algorithm weighing price history, quality ratings, reliability scores, proximity, past VibeHouse performance, and schedule fit.
	6	Automated Outreach: Send personalized RFQ (Request for Quotation) packages to the top-ranked contractors via email and SMS, including project scope, timeline, plans, and a response portal link.
	7	Bid Collection & Comparison: Aggregate incoming bids, normalize pricing structures, and present a comparison matrix to the homeowner with AI recommendations.
	8	Contract Generation: Upon selection, auto-generate scope-specific contracts with payment milestones tied to Trello card completion.

9.2 Outreach Communication Templates
All vendor communications are generated by the AI and customized per trade, project, and contractor. Templates include initial RFQ emails, follow-up reminders (3-day and 7-day), bid acceptance notifications, contract packages, onboarding instructions with Trello board access, and schedule confirmation messages. Each communication is logged in the project audit trail and linked to the corresponding Trello card.

10. Daily Reporting & Notifications

10.1 Daily Build Report
Every morning before 7:00 AM local time, the Reporting Engine generates and delivers a comprehensive Daily Build Report to all project stakeholders. The report is generated by scanning the Trello board state, internal project data, weather forecasts, and vendor communication logs.

10.2 Report Delivery
	•	Email: Full HTML report with embedded charts delivered to all stakeholders.
	•	SMS: A condensed 3-line summary with a link to the full report.
	•	Push Notification: Mobile app notification with key metrics and any action items.
	•	Trello Card: A daily report card is created in a dedicated "Reports" list on the Build Board with the full report attached as a PDF.

10.3 Real-Time Notification Engine
Beyond daily reports, the platform sends real-time notifications for critical events including: task completion confirmations, inspection pass/fail results, budget threshold breaches (75%, 90%, 100% of category budgets), schedule slip alerts when the critical path shifts, dispute filings and resolution updates, weather alerts that may impact scheduled work, contractor no-show detection (GPS + Trello activity), and change order requests.

11. Dispute Resolution Engine

11.1 Dispute Detection
The Dispute Engine uses natural language processing to analyze all communications across the platform and proactively identify potential conflicts before they escalate. Detection signals include:

	•	Sentiment Analysis: Negative sentiment trends in Trello comments, emails, or in-app messages. A sustained negative sentiment score triggers a pre-dispute alert.
	•	Schedule Conflict Detection: When two contractors are scheduled for overlapping work areas, when a task is blocked for more than 48 hours, or when a contractor misses two consecutive daily check-ins.
	•	Budget Variance Alerts: When actual costs for a line item exceed the estimate by more than 15%, or when cumulative spending trends indicate a likely budget overrun.
	•	Quality Concern Flags: When inspection checklists have more than 2 failed items, when a contractor requests rework, or when the homeowner flags a concern in any communication.

11.2 Dispute Workflow
When a dispute is identified (either proactively by the AI or manually by a stakeholder), it enters a structured four-stage resolution workflow:

Stage
Duration
Actions
Escalation Trigger
1. Identification
0-4 hours
AI drafts dispute summary, notifies parties, creates Trello card in Dispute list, gathers evidence
Auto-escalates if no acknowledgment in 4 hours
2. Direct Resolution
24-72 hours
Parties negotiate via structured in-app messaging. AI suggests resolutions based on contract terms and precedent
Escalates if no agreement in 72 hours
3. AI Mediation
48-96 hours
AI presents binding resolution options based on contract analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and project impact
Escalates if both parties reject all AI options
4. External Mediation
5-15 days
Platform connects parties with a licensed construction mediator. Full documentation package auto-generated
Legal referral if mediation fails

11.3 Dispute Prompting System
The user-facing dispute interface is conversational. When a dispute is detected or filed, the system prompts the homeowner through a guided process:

	•	"We noticed [specific issue]. Would you like to flag this as a concern?"
	•	"The contractor has responded with [summary]. Here are your options: Accept, Counter-Propose, Escalate."
	•	"Based on your contract and similar projects, we recommend [specific resolution]. Here is our reasoning."
	•	"This dispute has been open for [X days]. Would you like to escalate to formal mediation?"
Every prompt includes full context, relevant contract clauses, cost implications, and schedule impact of each option.

12.3 Async Architecture
The entire backend is async-first. All I/O-bound operations use Python asyncio with async database drivers (asyncpg), async HTTP clients (httpx), and async Redis connections (redis.asyncio). CPU-bound operations like AI model inference and document generation are offloaded to Celery workers running in separate containers, preventing the API servers from blocking.

15. Security & Compliance

15.1 Authentication & Authorization
	•	OAuth 2.0 + JWT: All API access requires valid JWT tokens issued via OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. Tokens expire after 1 hour with refresh token rotation.
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Four roles: Homeowner, Contractor, Inspector, Admin. Each role has granular permissions mapped to API endpoints and data visibility.
	•	Multi-Factor Authentication: Required for all financial operations, contract signing, and dispute escalation actions.
	•	API Key Management: Service-to-service communication uses rotated API keys with IP whitelisting.

15.2 Data Protection
	•	Encryption at Rest: AES-256 encryption for all data in PostgreSQL (pgcrypto), S3 (SSE-S3), and Redis (TLS).
	•	Encryption in Transit: TLS 1.3 enforced on all connections. Certificate pinning for mobile clients.
	•	PII Handling: Personal information is stored in dedicated encrypted columns with access logging. Contractor SSN/EIN data is tokenized via Stripe Identity.
	•	Audit Logging: Every data access, modification, and API call is logged with actor, timestamp, IP, and before/after state diffs.

15.3 Compliance
	•	SOC 2 Type II: Targeted for Phase 2 certification. Controls implemented from Phase 1.
	•	CCPA/GDPR: Full data portability, deletion rights, consent management, and privacy dashboard.
	•	PCI DSS: Payment processing delegated to Stripe. No raw card data touches VibeHouse servers.
	•	Construction Licensing: Platform verifies contractor licenses against state databases before engagement.

16. Performance & Scalability

16.1 Scaling Strategy
VibeHouse is designed to scale horizontally at every layer. API servers are stateless and scale behind a load balancer. Celery workers scale independently per queue priority. PostgreSQL uses read replicas for reporting queries and connection pooling via PgBouncer. Redis Cluster provides distributed caching with automatic sharding.

18. User Interface & UX Flows

18.1 Platform Structure
VibeHouse provides three interfaces: a web application (React/Next.js), a mobile application (React Native), and the Trello Build Board. The web and mobile apps provide the full experience for homeowners. Contractors primarily interact through Trello and a lightweight mobile companion app.

18.2 Core User Flows

Flow 1: Vibe-to-Design (Homeowner)
	9	Onboarding: User creates account, provides build location and rough budget range.
	10	Vibe Session: Guided conversational interface captures the user's vision through natural language and reference image uploads.
	11	AI Processing: System generates Requirement Specification Object and produces 3 floor plan options.
	12	Design Review: User reviews plans in an interactive viewer with AI-annotated explanations of design decisions.
	13	Refinement Loop: User provides feedback ("make the kitchen bigger," "add a mudroom"). AI regenerates.
	14	Plan Finalization: User approves final design. Full construction document set is generated.
	15	Board Creation: Trello Build Board is auto-generated with the complete construction schedule.

Flow 2: Build Monitoring (Homeowner)
	16	Dashboard: User opens the VibeHouse dashboard showing project health, budget, timeline, and today's activities.
	17	Board Check: User navigates to the Trello Build Board (embedded or linked) to see current task status.
	18	Report Review: User reads the daily report delivered to email and available in-app.
	19	Action Response: User responds to any pending decisions, approvals, or dispute prompts.
	20	Photo Review: User browses site photos uploaded by contractors.

Flow 3: Dispute Resolution (Homeowner or Contractor)
	21	Alert: System detects an issue or a stakeholder files a dispute.
	22	Context Gathering: AI presents the dispute summary with full context, contract references, and options.
	23	Response: User selects from resolution options or provides a counter-proposal.
	24	Negotiation: Structured back-and-forth through the platform with AI facilitation.
	25	Resolution: Agreement is reached, documented, and reflected on the Trello board and project schedule.

Appendix C: Technology Decision Records

TDR-001: Python as Backend Language
Decision: Use Python as the primary backend language for all VibeHouse services.
Rationale: Python provides the strongest ecosystem for AI/ML integration (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, LangChain), mature async frameworks (FastAPI, Celery), excellent data processing libraries (Pandas, NumPy), and the largest pool of available engineering talent. The async capabilities of modern Python (3.12+) with FastAPI achieve performance characteristics competitive with Node.js and Go for I/O-bound workloads, which constitute the majority of VibeHouse operations.
Trade-offs: CPU-bound operations (document rendering, model inference) are offloaded to optimized C/Rust extensions or dedicated worker processes. Critical hot paths may be reimplemented in Rust via PyO3 if profiling indicates need.

TDR-002: Trello as Build Board Platform
Decision: Use Trello via the Atlassian API as the primary Build Board platform rather than building a custom board.
Rationale: Trello provides a familiar UX that reduces onboarding friction, a mature API with webhooks and Power-Ups, mobile apps for contractor access, and Atlassian-grade reliability. Building a custom board would add 3-4 months to Phase 1 with no immediate user benefit.
Trade-offs: Trello API rate limits (300 requests per 10 seconds per token) require careful request management. Custom board migration planned for Phase 3 if Trello becomes a scaling bottleneck.
